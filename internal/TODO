In the description file, include a description of the set.  This will
be included in the POD file.

Allow different alternatives based on a string, not just numeric.  For
example, in some languages:
   his clothes
   her clothes
use different words for clothes based on masculine/feminine.  Similar
differences also exist.  It would be nice to allow somthing similar to
the plural situation:
   VAL:element VALUE1 STRING1 VALUE2 STRING2 ... DEFAULT_STRING]
so:
   [hisher:element his '_hisher shirt' her '_hisher blouse' '_hisher top']
would produce the following:
   $obj->message('His/her top [hisher],'his')
      => 'his shirt'
   $obj->message('His/her top [hisher],'His')
      => 'His shirt'
   $obj->message('His/her top [hisher],'Her')
      => 'Her blouse'
   $obj->message('His/her top [hisher],"Jack's")
      => "Jack's top"
